        <li><h2>Navbar</h2>
        <p>The navbar, found on every page of the site, itself contains two enhancements: <strong>Dropdown content lists</strong> and <strong> Hover effects</strong> for each button.</p></li>

        <p>Hovering over the either the 'Products ▾' button or 'Blog ▾' button will cause a drop-down menu to appear, listing the various pages 
        under either of the categories i.e. bringing up all 4 categories of Brew N Go products when the 'Products ▾' button is hovered over.</p>  
        <p>Every button of the navbar will change colour from white to golden-yellow when hovered over. The buttons will also be underlined.</p>

            <img src="images/CART.png" alt="Shopping Cart Enhancement">
          </a>
          <li><h2>Shopping Cart</h2>
          <p>The shopping cart function can be found on every page, particularly the <a href="product1.html">products pages</a> where its effects are most apparent.
            When any item is selected and added to the user's selection, the item(s) will still appear in the Shopping Cart while visiting other pages of the site. The
            Shopping Cart can be opened by pressing the respective button, and can be closed through the 'Close' button in the sidebar or by pressing the Shopping Cart
            button again.
          </p>
        </li>

      <a href="index.html">
        <img src="images/MOBILEVIEW.png" alt="Mobile View Enhancement">
      </a>
      <li><h2>Mobile View</h2>
        <p>If the site is viewed using a mobile device, the site's layout will be reconfigured accordingly, making it easier to navigate.</p>
          
        <p>The layout of the currently viewed page shifts according to the viewing device's dimensions and configuration. Buttons will be hidden or repositioned 
        to better suit a mobile viewer while still retaining the overall structure of the original page.</p>
            
        <p>The navbar normally found on the top of the page will be hidden when being viewed using a phone or tablet due to the dynamic mobile dimensions feature. 
        Instead it will be hidden, replaced by a hamburger button on the top-left of the screen. Pressing this button causes the menu's buttons to be overlaid 
        onto the screen, allowing the user to navigate the site as normal.</p>
      </li>



      <br>



        <a href="index.html">
          <img src="images/FOOTER.png" alt="Footer Hover Enhancement">
        </a>
        <li><h2>Footer</h2>
        <p>The footer also has a separate hover effect, smoothly turning the text from white to yellow instead of golden-yellow.</p>
      </li>



      <br>



        <a href="index.html">
          <img src="images/CAROUSEL.png" alt="Carousel Section">
        </a>
        <li><h2>Carousel Section</h2>
        <p>The carousel section on the index page has its own separate hover effects, and - as is instantly visible - automatically scrolls through Brew N Go's item selection.
        The scrolling animation pauses when the user hovers over a certain item, continuing once the user stops.</p>
        <p>The carousel section also has its own hover effects. Hovering over an item will enlarge the contained image and raise the text slightly, as well as making the image's
        shadow cover a larger area.</p>
        </li>



        <br>


        
        <a href="index.html">
          <img src="images/FLIPCARD.png" alt="Membership Flip Cards">
        </a>
        <li><h2>Membership Flip Cards</h2>
        <p>The membership section has 2 separate hover effects.</p>
        <p>Firstly, when hovering over either of the pictures in the main membership section ("Front of the Queue" and "Behind the Brew"), both pictures will appear to flip over,
        to display cards with relevant information on them. This is in addition to the standard hover effects for buttons. As expected, moving the cursor away will cause the card
        to flip over again.</p>
        <p>The membership perks section below also has its own hover effect. When hovering over any of the 5 cards in this section, the image will enlarge itself and display text
        which disappears when the user stops hovering over it. This hover effect also causes the other cards to be shifted around organically.</p>
      </li>



      <br>



        <a href="index.html">
          <img src="images/MAPENHANCEMENT.png" alt="Map Enhancement">
        </a>
        <li><h2>Interactive Map</h2>
        <p>The map section contains 2 interactive Google Maps integrations. Both have the locations of Brew N Go branches marked on them, and allow the user to scroll through the map
        using Ctrl + Mouse. The map can be zoomed in and out, the use of satellite imaging instead of usual road routes can be toggled, and so on.</p>
        </li>


        <br>



          <a href="index.html">
            <img src="images/VIDEOLOOP.png" alt="Looping Video Section">
          </a>
          <li><h2>Looping Videos</h2>
        <p>At the bottom of the page, 2 videos are continuously looping on either side of the 'Join Us' button.</p>
        </li>



        <br>



      <a href="product1.html">
        <img src="images/CATEGORYSIDEBAR.png" alt="Category Hover Effects">
      </a>
      <li><h2>Category Sidebar Hover</h2>
        <p>Hovering over any category button in the sidebar will cause the button to be coloured blue and cause the text to change colours from black to white. Hovering over any item will cause
        the button to be highlighted by elevating it and expanding the drop shadow, and hovering over the picture will also cause the picture to expand. These effects revert upon the user's cursor
        being moved away.
        </p>
      </li>

      <a href="blog.html">
        <img src="images/ACTIVITYSLIDESHOW.png" alt="Slideshow Feature">
      </a>
      <li><h2>Slideshow</h2>
        <p>The pictures in the Past Activities section of the page will change at regular intervals, and each picture can be clicked to take the user to <a href="past_activity.html">the Past Activities page</a>.</p>  
        </li>

        
        
        
        <a href="blog.html">
          <img src="images/ACTIVITYHOVER.png" alt="Blog Hover Effects">
        </a>
        <li><h2>Blog Hover Effects</h2>
          <p>Each individual slide, when hovered over, will display different text in regards to the event - the date and summary of the event in most cases. Hovering over the event listed under 'Coming Soon' causes a similar effect.
          </p>
        </li>

        <a href="profile1.html">
          <img src="images/PROFILECARD.png" alt="Profile Page Cards">
        </a>
        <li><h2>Profile Page Cards</h2>
          <p>The profile page showcases structured information inside individual cards categorized by experience, education, skills, and personal achievements. Each category is collapsible for easier reading and accessibility. The cards feature hover-enhanced logos that scale up and include links to official websites (e.g., Swinburne, FAME, VEEKS). This improves interactivity while maintaining clarity in presenting background credentials.</p>
