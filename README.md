Selectors: element ÔÇ£, #id ÔÇ£, .class ÔÇ£, grouping ÔÇ£, context ÔÇ£, pseudo ÔÇ£
‚Ä¢ Fluid page flow (relative dimensions) ÔÇ£


................................
Enhancements (Optional for Higher Marks):
To score full HD marks, implement advanced CSS or HTML techniques (no JavaScript), such as:

- Embedding external content (Google Maps, YouTube videos, photo galleries).
- Advanced HTML5 elements (Canvas, Video, Audio).
- Responsive design optimized for mobile/tablets.
- Advanced CSS selectors and pseudo-elements.
- Clearly document your enhancements on an enhancements.html page, including references and examples.

...........................
Individual Report & Video:
- Report (600-1200 words) must clearly explain website structure, style, and features.
- Video (10-12 minutes) demonstrating the website with equal contribution from all team members.



You can develop enhancements on your Web site that go beyond the requirements specified above.
This is an opportunity to demonstrate your ability to discover techniques from a range of sources and
apply them in a standards compliant manner.
These enhancements need to be implemented on your existing Web pages (index.html, <service
pages>.html, order.html, and <about me pages>.html). The extra feature needs to enhance your Web
site in a relevant way.
On a separate Web page called enhancement1.html list and describe each enhancement you have made
and how you have significantly extended the basic HTML and CSS beyond what is covered in the Labs.
Hyperlink from the list to where the feature is implemented on your Web site. If it is a CSS feature,
hyperlink to an example of the html that is selected by the CSS rule.
Any enhancements that are not listed and linked on the Enhancements page will not be
assessed. Note: Do not implement your extra features within the enhancement1.html page.
Examples of HTML/CSS enhancements you might make that will contribute a higher mark include:
‚Ä¢ Embedding External Content in your webpage i.e. Google Maps (about.html), related Youtube
video, Photo gallery engine, widgets etc.
‚Ä¢ Effective and appropriate use of other HTML5 elements not covered in tutorials (e.g. Canvas,
Video, Audio). Note: some HTML5 elements may not be fully supported by Firefox, so make sure
you check first as the assignment will be tested on Firefox.
‚Ä¢ An additional CSS file(s) that presents your Web site specifically for mobile phone / tablet sized
displays.
‚Ä¢ Additional CSS properties or selectors (e.g. support for interactivity) not covered in the tutorials.
For example the use of CSS pseudo-elements and classes, child or siblings combinators, attribute
selectors, etc.
‚Ä¢ Additional comments in the CSS files to show how to edit the declaration values to, for example,
change the colour scheme. Comments must be in the context of its application, and not general
comments.
Note: Do not include JavaScript in this assignment.
Your Enhancement page must list the enhancements you have implemented. For each
feature briefly explain:
‚Ä¢ how it goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment
‚Ä¢ what code is needed to implement the feature
‚Ä¢ if you have sourced your technique from a third party the source of this technique (e.g. URL)
o must be cited.
‚Ä¢ a hyperlink to where you have applied that extension in your Web site (this is need so the
tutor can quickly assess your enhancements during the demonstration).
‚Ä¢ All enhancements must be able to run on Chrome or Firefox. Make sure you check this.
To gain a full 20 marks for a feature it must:
‚Ä¢ Be relevant to / enhance the content of the Web site
‚Ä¢ Be well described (as explained above)
‚Ä¢ Be non-trivial. Judging this will be at the sole discretion of your tutor/marker. As a guide if the
enhancement has only taken a couple of lines of code it is likely to be trivial.
A maximum of 4 enhancements will be assessed.
